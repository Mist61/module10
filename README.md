Use an interface when you want to define a common behavior for unrelated classes, like flying or driving, and don’t need to share code—just method names.
Interfaces are great for adding capabilities and allow multiple inheritance. Use an abstract class when classes are closely related and share common code,
fields, or constructors. Abstract classes are best when there’s an “is-a” relationship and you want to provide default behavior that subclasses can build on.
